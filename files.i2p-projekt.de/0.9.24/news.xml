<h3>2016-01-27: <b>0.9.24 <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/blog/post/2016/01/27/0.9.24-Release">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
0.9.24 contains a new version of SAM (v3.2) and numerous bug fixes and efficiency improvements.
Note that this release is the first to require Java 7.
Please update to Java 7 or 8 as soon as possible.
Your router will not automatically update if you are using Java 6.

To prevent the problems caused by the ancient commons-logging library, we have removed it.
This will cause very old I2P-Bote plugins (0.2.10 and below, signed by HungryHobo) to crash if they have IMAP enabled.
The recommended fix is to replace your old I2P-Bote plugin with the current one signed by str4d.
For more details, see <a href="http://bote.i2p/news/0.4.3">this post</a>.
